## Introduction

My 3D Game Project, developed with Unreal Engine 5, presents you a simple and interesting puzzle game with 8 levels that are increasingly difficult than the previous one and with new puzzle elements

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine and run the game.

### Prerequisites

- Unreal Engine 5.2 installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

    git clone https://github.com/jb46907/3d-game-project.git

2. Open Unreal Engine and navigate to the "File" menu.

3. Select "Open Project," browse to the location where you cloned the repository, and choose the "3d-game-project" folder.

4. Unreal Engine will load the project, and you will be ready to start working with it.

### Running the Game

1. In Unreal Engine's Content Browser, locate the menu level (e.g., MenuLevel.umap).

2. Double-click on the menu level to open it in the Editor.

3. Press the "Play" button at the top of the Unreal Engine Editor to run the game in Play mode.

Now you can enjoy playing the game right within Unreal Engine!

## Controls

Here are the default controls to navigate through the game:

- WASD: Move the character forward, left, backward, and right.
- P: Pause the game or open the in-game menu.

Please note that these controls can be customized in the settings menu.
